The code here is an implementation of big integers.
It is realized by using lists - structure with data, pointer to the next node and to the previous one.
BigInt is realized as a class with methods allowing defining and printing it.
There are also some operator overloads - operator<< , operator+ , operator-
The BigInt comes with full logic for summing two numbers and subtracting them implementend in mentioned operator+
